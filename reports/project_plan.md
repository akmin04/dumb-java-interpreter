# Project Plan

**DJI - Dumb Java Interpreter**

*A simple interpreter for a small subset of syntax and features from Java.*

Andy Min - 2021 April 30

## Challenges

- Creating a modular system and organized class structure to be able to easily add new features
- Writing a full testing suite with integration tests

## Major Tasks and Schedule

| Task                                                         | When                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Plan out what features/syntax to include. Organize what tokens the lexer will generate and what nodes of an abstract syntax tree the parser will generate. | Week 1                 |
| Write and test the lexer and program tokens                  | Week 2                 |
| Write and test token parser to generate an abstract syntax tree | Week 3                 |
| Write an interpreter engine to run the abstract syntax tree and produce outputs | Week 4                 |
| Create a GUI that can highlight/visualize the tokens and the abstract syntax tree of a given program for the user to better understand the stages of a compiler/interpreter. | Extra time if possible |
