*A simple interpreter for a small subset of syntax and features from Java.*

Andy Min - 2021 May 27

## Accomplishments

- Designed and wrote all classes
- Debugged program to nearly follow initial project specification
- Basic testing with example programs
- Clean documentation
- Nice CLI application using an external argument parsing library

## Learning Experience

- Further practice in utilizing object oriented design principles with Java
- Learned more on how compilers/interpreters work
- Learned how to use GraalVM native images
- Learned how to use Java 9 modules

## Objectives

### Challenge

The project was overall pretty challenging, especially under the time frame. Although the project fell a little behind schedule from the initial plan, I was able to finish the project and get it working.

### Effort

Although I tried my best to distribute the work over the time span efficiently, the time crunch meant I ended up putting much more work towards the later weeks. Overall put lot's of effort into getting the project functional.

### Quality

Overall satisfied with how the project turned out in terms of organization, code quality, and results. E.g. the runtime engine was well designed and clean.

### Problem Solving

Referenced resources such as Ruslan Spivak's "Let's Build A Simple Interpreter" and the LLVM Kaleidoscope compiler tutorial.

### Results

Happy with the results and the amount of features built into the interpreter, such as for/while loops, break/continue statements, and recursion.

### Teamwork

## Overall Assessment

The project was a challenging success and I was able to implement nearly all of the features listed in the preliminary specification plan while maintaining clean code and organization. (A)
